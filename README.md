# Quiz application

This app is created to practice with Vue.js + pinia + TS. Also Vuetify was choosen as component framework.

The idea of the project is to create app where users can pass quizes/tests and get results. The admin of the project should be able to edit quizes collection.

To test admin section use credentials: `Admin/1234`

List of features to implement:
- add possibility to add new quiz in admin section (now it is possible only edit existed quizes)
- show errors in the end of quiz to user (now we show only score)
- store user progress, mark passed quizes in UI
- profile page with user's analytics
- add quiz metadata, like difficulty
- add score value for questions and update score calculations
